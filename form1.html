            1. Loan Disbursement
The loan amount will be credited to the borrower’s account upon the completion of all formalities, including submission and verification of required documentation.<br/>

2. Interest Rate
The loan will carry an interest rate of X% (fixed/variable), calculated on a reducing balance method. Changes in the variable interest rate will be communicated at least 30 days in advance.

3. Loan Repayment
The loan will be repaid in equated monthly installments (EMIs) over a period of Y months. The EMI schedule, including due dates and amounts, will be shared with the borrower. Early payments or prepayments will reduce the outstanding balance accordingly, subject to the bank's prepayment policies.<br/>

4. Prepayment and Foreclosure
Prepayment of the loan, either in part or full, is allowed after a minimum lock-in period of Z months. A prepayment fee of P% will be charged on the outstanding principal for any prepayment made before the lock-in period ends.<br/>

5. Fees and Charges
A processing fee of Q% of the loan amount will be deducted before disbursement.
Late payment will incur a penalty fee of R% per month on the overdue amount.
Administrative fees for account maintenance and documentation changes, if any, will be applicable as per the bank’s schedule of charges.<br/>
6. Collateral and Security
For secured loans, the borrower agrees to pledge assets, such as real estate or financial instruments, as collateral. In case of default, the bank reserves the right to seize the collateral and recover the loan amount through appropriate legal channels.<br/>

7. Loan Purpose
The loan must be used exclusively for the stated purpose, as mentioned in the application. Any deviation in the usage of funds must be approved by the bank in writing.<br/>
